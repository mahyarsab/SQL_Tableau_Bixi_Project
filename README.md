<img alt="image" src="https://allvectorlogo.com/img/2017/07/bixi-montreal-logo.png">

This project consists of two parts. In the first part I will use SQL to dig into the Bixi dataset. While in the second part I will further explore the data using Tableau and consistent with the visualization. My goal is to gain a high level understanding of how people use Bixi bikes, what factors influence the volume of usage, popular stations and overall business growth.


The data is a cleaned up version of data downloaded from the open data portal at Bixi Montreal:
